# Smooth_Move_App
Smooth Move' Movement Test Manager.
This application will use the built-in motion sensors in a smartphone to gather data about the smoothness of a given phone movement. The idea is that the existing sensors in the cell phone can be used as a budget measurement system that can provide data (remotely) to clinicians, therapists, and coaches. To do this the phone would be grasped in the hand or attached to the body while a person executes a given movement.
